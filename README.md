# Support fvm

If you have set `legacy_version_file = yes` in `$HOME/.asdfrc`, you can read the Flutter version from `.fvm/fvm_config.json`, the [fvm](https://fvm.app/) configuration file.

To fix the "Could not find a Flutter SDK" error, you can set the `FLUTTER_ROOT` environment variable in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export FLUTTER_ROOT="$(asdf where flutter)"
```
